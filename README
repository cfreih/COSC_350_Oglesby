This project is to develop a program to best allow Osbert Oglesby to make smart purchases
on French paintings. It is being done by Clint Freiheit, Sam Bock, Tim Burwitz, and Claudio
Acre Cascantes. 

Pseudocode has been added to the project. This will be the start of the coding.

More will be added to the README as the project gets closer to completion.
